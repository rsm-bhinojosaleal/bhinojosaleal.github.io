randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\ntodo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper.

The intercept is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001), indicating a non-zero baseline level of the dependent variable.\n#Ratio1 (0.0029): The coefficient of ratio1 is 0.0029, suggesting that a one-unit increase in ratio1 is associated with an increase of 0.0029 in the expected value of gave, holding other variables constant. However, this effect is not statistically significant at the typical 0.05 level (p = 0.097), indicating that changes in ratio1 may not reliably predict changes in gave.\n#Ratio2 (0.0048): The coefficient for ratio2 is 0.0048, which is statistically significant (p = 0.006). This suggests that a one-unit increase in ratio2 is associated with an increase of 0.0048 in gave, all else being equal. The result is likely to be a reliable predictor of gave.\n#Ratio3 (0.0049): Similar to ratio2, ratio3 shows a statistically significant positive effect on gave (p = 0.005). Each one-unit increase in ratio3 leads to an increase of 0.0049 in the expected value of gave\n#The standard errors are similar to the ones on the papaer which means The standard error here is almost as large as the coefficient itself (0.0029), indicating a lower level of precision. \n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Note that \\(f(Y|\\lambda) = e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^Y/Y!\\).\ntodo: Code the likelihood (or log-likelihood) function for the Poisson model. This is a function of lambda and Y. For example:\npoisson_loglikelihood &lt;- function(lambda, Y){\n   ...\n}\ntodo: Use your function to plot lambda on the horizontal axis and the likelihood (or log-likelihood) on the vertical axis for a range of lambdas (use the observed number of patents as the input for Y).\ntodo: If you’re feeling mathematical, take the first derivative of your likelihood or log-likelihood, set it equal to zero and solve for lambda. You will find lambda_mle is Ybar, which “feels right” because the mean of a Poisson distribution is lambda.\ntodo: Find the MLE by optimizing your likelihood function with optim() in R or sp.optimize() in Python.\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.\ntodo: Update your likelihood or log-likelihood function with an additional argument to take in a covariate matrix X. Also change the parameter of the model from lambda to the beta vector. In this model, lambda must be a positive number, so we choose the inverse link function g() to be exp() so that \\(\\lambda_i = e^{X_i'\\beta}\\). For example:\npoisson_regression_likelihood &lt;- function(beta, Y, X){\n   ...\n}\ntodo: Use your function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates. Specifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable. Use the Hessian to find standard errors of the beta parameter estimates and present a table of coefficients and standard errors.\ntodo: Check your results using R’s glm() function or Python sm.GLM() function.\ntodo: Interpret the results. What do you conclude about the effect of Blueprinty’s software on patent success?"

In this model, lambda must be a positive number, so we choose the inverse link function g() to be exp() so that \\(\\lambda_i = e^{X_i'\\beta}\\). For example:\npoisson_regression_likelihood &lt;- function(beta, Y, X){\n   ...\n}\ntodo: Use your function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates. Specifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable. Use the Hessian to find standard errors of the beta parameter estimates and present a table of coefficients and standard errors.\ntodo: Check your results using R’s glm() function or Python sm.GLM() function.\ntodo: Interpret the results. What do you conclude about the effect of Blueprinty’s software on patent success?"

    "text": "AirBnB Case Study\n\nIntroduction\nAirBnB is a popular platform for booking short-term rentals. In March 2017, students Annika Awad, Evan Lebo, and Anna Linden scraped of 40,000 Airbnb listings from New York City. The data include the following variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n- `id` = unique ID number for each unit\n- `last_scraped` = date when information scraped\n- `host_since` = date when host first listed the unit on Airbnb\n- `days` = `last_scraped` - `host_since` = number of days the unit has been listed\n- `room_type` = Entire home/apt., Private room, or Shared room\n- `bathrooms` = number of bathrooms\n- `bedrooms` = number of bedrooms\n- `price` = price per night (dollars)\n- `number_of_reviews` = number of reviews for the unit on Airbnb\n- `review_scores_cleanliness` = a cleanliness score from reviews (1-10)\n- `review_scores_location` = a \"quality of location\" score from reviews (1-10)\n- `review_scores_value` = a \"quality of value\" score from reviews (1-10)\n- `instant_bookable` = \"t\" if instantly bookable, \"f\" if not\n\n\n\ntodo: Assume the number of reviews is a good proxy for the number of bookings. Perform some exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the data, handle or drop observations with missing values on relevant variables, build one or more models (e.g., a poisson regression model for the number of bookings as proxied by the number of reviews), and interpret model coefficients to describe variation in the number of reviews as a function of the variables provided."
